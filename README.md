***How Does it work***

[![GPSoAuth](http://www.google.com/logos/doodles/2015/googles-new-logo-5078286822539264.3-hp2x.gif)]()

- Login using [gpsoauth](https://github.com/simon-weber/gpsoauth). Google Player Services oAuth Protocol
- Stores necessary tokens until they expire.
- Supports multiple simultaneous tokens
- Before each request, the tokens are verified to be valid, or if invalid, then refreshed.
- Single HTTP session per URI for maximum performance, though certain APIs require two seconds between each call (or they are ignored)

## Example (Optional)

- Good: Add an API call at the bottom of SPPD_API.py, then `./SPPD_API.py <username> <password>`
- Better:

```python
# code away!
import SPPD_API
import json

class SingleUser():
  ...  ...  ...
  def run(self):
    SPPD_API.setUsernamePassword("you@gmail.com","pw123")
    response_body = SPPD_API.getTeamWarUpdate() #Specific to you@gmail.com's team.
    result = processTeamWarUpdate(response_body)
    if result == None:
      print("Bad Data...")
#Mode:
# 0, vote days
# 1, upgrade days
# 2, battle days
  def processTeamWarUpdate(self,json_string):
    result={}
    try:
      result = json.loads(json_string)
    except Exception as e:
      print(str(e))
    if "configuration" in result and type(result["configuration"]) == dict:
      if "upgrade_start_time" in result["configuration"].keys():
        upgrade_start_time = result["configuration"]["upgrade_start_time"]
        if upgrade_start_time != self.UPGRADE_START_TIME:
          self.resetAllUpgrades()
          self.UPGRADE_START_TIME = upgrade_start_time
          last_refresh_pretty=time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', time.localtime(self.UPGRADE_START_TIME))
          print(f"UPGRADE_START_TIME: {last_refresh_pretty}")
      if "battle_start_time" in result["configuration"].keys():
        battle_start_time = result["configuration"]["battle_start_time"]
        if battle_start_time != self.BATTLE_START_TIME:
          self.BATTLE_START_TIME = battle_start_time
          last_refresh_pretty=time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', time.localtime(self.BATTLE_START_TIME))
          print(f"BATTLE_START_TIME: {last_refresh_pretty}")
    if '"mode": 1' in json_string or (self.BATTLE_START_TIME > time.time() - 300 and self.UPGRADE_START_TIME < time.time() + 1800):
      return self.processTeamWarUpgrades(json_string)
    elif '"mode": 2' in json_string:
      return self.processTeamWarBracket(json_string)
    elif '"mode": 0' in json_string:
      return 0 #Success, nothing to do
    return None #Fail
```

## FAQ

- **Can I use my iOS account?**
    - No. Not until someone can spare some time to be the first person in the world to reverse engineer Apple Gamecenter's oAuth.

- **Can I call Python code from NodeJS?**
    - Where there's a will, [there's a way](https://discord.com/channels/@me/694341743780560966/795113507141976064)
